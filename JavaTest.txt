1.checked exception
  It will be compile time exception.
  it will check at the time of writtening
Unchecked Exception
 it will occur during runtime.
 it will shows error after compling while executing and it will show Arithmetic exception

2.try used to enclose the code that throw the exception
  catch is used to handle the exception
 finally is used to finalise that function but catch is used to handle the exception
 try block can be run without catch by using a resource with a closed block
ex: try(Scanner sc = new Scanner()){
    return sc.nextline;
}
4.polymorphism
Same object with different behaviour
types
Run-time polymorphism
Compile-time polymorphism

5.Hiding the implementation details and provide necessary information to the user.
  By using abstract class we can extend the sub classes and by using interface we implements the sub classes.

7.ArrayList is uses dynamic array to store values
  In array list manipulation is slow
  it act as a list
 LinkedList uses double linkedlist to store elements
 manipulation is faster
 it act as list and queue
